We find that Google CDN gives the best performance with an average total response time of 0.48s. However, multiple requests to google.* domains are in fact redirected since Google detected that we are using a script to measure response timings. The worst performer was Alibaba CDN. In general, sites using CDNs outperformed those not using CDNs when comparing median time taken to load the complete page by 0.2s. Sites not using CDNs take 5x the time for TCP handshake, and 3x the time for SSL negotiation, when compared to those using CDNs. Time taken for DNS lookup, and WAIT time for server response is same across both groups.\nGrouping by ASN, we find that Google and Microsoft have the best performance, while Alibaba and ChinaNet have the worst performance. This is consistent with our timing analysis when grouped by CDNs. We found that 74.67% of detected CDN names correspond directly to the AS name. Two websites, liputan6.com and trello.com were using ASNs different from the detected CDN used to host most content on their webpages. Furthermore, we found 22 websites that were not using CDNs, hosted on ASes that also offer CDNs if needed.\nFor more details, please visit: Report\n","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1568910827,"objectID":"a5f2cb77983cbfe3fcb3e7c0fa61d9d2","permalink":"https://sarthakgrover.github.io/project/cdn-analysis/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/cdn-analysis/","section":"project","summary":"Measurement and comparison of page load times across identifiable CDNs","tags":[],"title":"CDN Analysis","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":" Customer Owned and Managed (COAM) Internet of Things (IoT) security  Used DPI to study connectivity, security, and privacy of a subset of Comcast smart homes Developed script to search for PII in unencrypted IoT data Identified malfunctioning XBOX in one of the subscribers  ","date":1464739200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1568911154,"objectID":"722ff41f749feb887376a39b7eaec2ca","permalink":"https://sarthakgrover.github.io/project/iot-dpi-analysis/","publishdate":"2016-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/iot-dpi-analysis/","section":"project","summary":"Analysis of home network data collected from Comcast customers","tags":[],"title":"IOT DPI Analysis","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":" Tested multiple IoT devices in lab and exposed security and privacy issues at PrivacyCon 2016 Found that a digital photoframe was susceptible to eavesdroppers and fails to encrypt photographs, and nest thermostat exposed private location information of nearest weather stations to the ISP (now patched) \\hfill[\\href{https://www.cs.princeton.edu/news/citp-stitching-internet-things}{Link}] Link to presentation Link to talk  ","date":1446336000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1568911093,"objectID":"ed422efb02fd885d3ff7ff7aadb87838","permalink":"https://sarthakgrover.github.io/project/iot-privacy/","publishdate":"2015-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/iot-privacy/","section":"project","summary":"Internet of Unpatched Things","tags":[],"title":"IoT Privacy","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Internet service providers are facing mounting pressure from regulatory agencies to increase the speed of their service offerings to consumers; some are beginning to deploy gigabit-per-second speeds in certain markets, as well. The race to deploy increasingly faster speeds begs the question of whether users are exhausting the capacity that is already available. Previous work has shown that users who are already maximizing their usage on a given access link will continue to do so when they are migrated to a higher service tier.\nIn a unique controlled experiment involving thousands of Comcast subscribers in the same city, we analyzed usage patterns of two groups: a control group (105 Mbps) and a randomly selected treatment group that was upgraded to 250 Mbps without their knowledge. We study how users who are already on service plans with high downstream throughput respond when they are upgraded to a higher service tier without their knowledge, as compared to a similar control group. To our surprise, subscribers with moderate traffic demands increase their usage in response to a service-tier upgrade relatively more than high-volume subscribers do. We speculate that even though these users may not take advantage of the full available capacity, the service-tier increase generally improves performance, which causes them to use the Internet more than they otherwise would have.\n Analyzed broadband usage patterns of a user group offered higher speed broadband without their knowledge; Found that difference in traffic demand was higher for moderate users as compared to high-volume subscribers Presented at CableLabs (Jul 2016) and FCC (Oct 2016) Link to video Link to paper  ","date":1425168000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1568911049,"objectID":"501ab5cc7b77a1fcbe888dcf038d4669","permalink":"https://sarthakgrover.github.io/project/broadband-upgrade/","publishdate":"2015-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/broadband-upgrade/","section":"project","summary":"Case study of traffic demand response to broadband service-plan upgrades","tags":[],"title":"Broadband Upgrade","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":" Designed and implemented a new encoding technique that uses web search terms to encode hidden messages in an upstream channel for censorship circumvention to resist fingerprinting attacks.
