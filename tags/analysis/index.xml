      <title>CDN Analysis</title>
      <link>https://sarthakgrover.github.io/project/cdn-analysis/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

&lt;p&gt;In this work, we compared average page load times for the top 500 Alexa websites across CDNs and ASNs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on our algorithm, we estimated that 300 websites are using CDNs. We find that Google CDN gives the best performance with an average total response time of 0.48s. However, multiple requests to google.* domains are in fact redirected since Google detected that we are using a script to measure response timings. The worst performer was Alibaba CDN. In general, sites using CDNs outperformed those not using CDNs when comparing median time taken to load the complete page by 0.2s. Sites not using CDNs take 5x the time for TCP handshake, and 3x the time for SSL negotiation, when compared to those using CDNs. Time taken for DNS lookup, and WAIT time for server response is same across both groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://sarthakgrover.github.io/img/cdn_timing_comparison.png&#34; alt=&#34;CDN Analysis Results&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grouping by ASN, we find that Google and Microsoft have the best performance, while Alibaba and ChinaNet have the worst performance. This is consistent with our timing analysis when grouped by CDNs. We found that 74.67% of detected CDN names correspond directly to the AS name. Two websites, liputan6.com and trello.com were using ASNs different from the detected CDN used to host most content on their webpages. Furthermore, we found 22 websites that were not using CDNs, hosted on ASes that also offer CDNs if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Broadband Upgrade</title>
      <link>https://sarthakgrover.github.io/project/broadband-upgrade/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Internet service providers are facing mounting pressure from
regulatory agencies to increase the speed of their service offerings to
consumers; some are beginning to deploy gigabit-per-second speeds in
certain markets, as well. The race to deploy increasingly faster speeds
begs the question of whether users are exhausting the capacity that is
already available. Previous work has shown that users who are already
maximizing their usage on a given access link will continue to do so when
they are migrated to a higher service tier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a unique controlled experiment involving thousands of Comcast subscribers in the same city, we analyzed usage patterns of two groups: a
control group (105 Mbps) and a randomly selected treatment group that
was upgraded to 250 Mbps without their knowledge. We study how users
who are already on service plans with high downstream throughput respond when they are upgraded to a higher service tier without their
knowledge, as compared to a similar control group. To our surprise, subscribers with moderate traffic demands increase their usage in response
to a service-tier upgrade relatively more than high-volume subscribers
do. We speculate that even though these users may not take advantage
of the full available capacity, the service-tier increase generally improves
performance, which causes them to use the Internet more than they otherwise would have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analyzed broadband usage patterns of a user group offered higher speed broadband without their knowledge; Found that difference in traffic demand was higher for moderate users as compared to high-volume subscribers&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Detect the performance bottleneck in a home network by collaborating between home devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Created a monitoring system to collect detailed wireless measurements from synchronized devices in a home, and manage and upload this data to the centralized server for analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tested uplink and downlink broadband performance from devices to detect if bottleneck is in the local wireless network or at the edge router.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We develop the browserlab daemon that listens on multiple network devices in a home, and propose collaborative bottleneck detection algorithm to identify if the access link is the bottleneck or the wireless is. Next, the daemon will be ported as a browser extension to scale the solution and collect large scale home wireless measurements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Integrating and extending the Fathom and BISmark measurement platforms to develop a home network troubleshooter for internal and external network diagnosis. The API allows a user to communicate between connected clients, and with the gateway, to issue parallel tests to analyse the home networks performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Monitoring system deployed on BISmark gateways to collect active and passive measurements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Found most home traffic is exchanged from a few devices to a small number of popular domains.&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Analyzed traceroute data from access networks to a variety of Internet destinations and examined route persistence and prevalence. Our aim is to associate home network performance metrics with path changes due to traffic engineering policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preliminary results were presented in a talk at Active Internet Measurement Symposium (AIMS), CAIDA.&lt;/p&gt;
